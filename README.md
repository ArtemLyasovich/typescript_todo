This project is a task management application built using React and TypeScript. The foundation of the development was a YouTube course, where I rewrote the code step by step and then enhanced it with my own improvements, such as adding a priority flag for tasks.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Highlight important tasks

## Technologies

- TypeScript
- CSS

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
```sh

   npm start
```

## Enhancements and Modifications
- Added a priority flag for tasks to facilitate sorting
- Improved styles for better readability of the task list
- Optimized code for better TypeScript support
- Enhanced user experience with intuitive interactions
- Improved overall performance and maintainability
